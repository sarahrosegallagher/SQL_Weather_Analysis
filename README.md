# SQL_Weather_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
This analysis leveraged SQLAlchemy, Flask, and other tools in Python (pandas, numpy) to provide stakeholders with weather insights to inform decision-making. We used a SQLite database of data from weather stations on Ohahu that contained the weather station id, the date, the temperature, and the precipitation from 2010 to 2018.


The deliverables contained in June_Dec_Analysis.ipynb are summary statistics for the temperatures in June and December, across all 8 years of data collected.
